 *  Package that contains the information of the network.                                                              *
 *  A network has the information of all the frames and its dependencies (Application constraints of different types). *
 *  All frames are saved in an array.                                                                                  *
 *  Additions of new relations between frames are supposed to be added here, while the behavior is on the schedule,    *
 *  as done with the application constraints, period and deadlines.                                                    *
