 *  Package that contains the information of a single frame in the network.                                            *
 *  A frame should contain the information of period, deadline, size and the tree path it is following, including      *
 *  in which switches it is spliting to multiple links.                                                                *
 *  It also contains the offset for every link. As it is meant to work with different solvers, it also contains its    *
