 *  Package that contains the information and algorithgms to synthesize the Schedule.                                  *
 *  Different algorithms to build the schedule and store it in a sortered array of all frames in the network. Such     *
 *  array will the ordered by the order in which the frames will be scheduled (in iterative and segmented approaches)  *
 *  It also contains auxiliar structures to save characteristics of the frames and the network in order to perfom the  *
 *  scheduling.                                                                                                        *
 *  The main approaches used are one-shot, incremental and segmented. Every technique has a different                  *
 *  performance. The better performance, the worse "quality" the final schedule will be.                               *
 *  Also numerous optimizations can be applied to different techniques to try to modify the "quality" of the schedules *
 *                                                                                                                     *
